        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Aeri / B444ndit</p>
        <p>I'm a Filipino college student majoring in Multimedia Arts with specialization in Digital Animation and Film at Far Eastern University Institute of Technology. With this portfolio, not only I want to showcase the outputs I made throughout the academic year, but also my love for art and designing.</p>
        <p>With passion, I love exploring different styles and learning about visual arts. My art style is flexible, and I can adapt to my client’s preferences. I’m constantly looking for opportunities to enhance my skills while creating a great experience for my clients as an artist.</p>
        <p>With my knowledge and ability, I'm prepared to do my best.</p>
